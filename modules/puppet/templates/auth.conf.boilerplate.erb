# This file is managed by Puppet, changes may be overwitten
#
# This is a managed auth.conf file, which implements the ACL rules
# used by the puppet master. Check the documentation for the puppet::auth
# class for the puppet module: https://github.com/nesi/puppet-puppet
#
# The ACLs are evaluated in top-down order. More specific stanzas should
# be towards the top of the file and more general ones at the bottom;
# otherwise, the general rules may "steal" requests that should be
# governed by the specific rules.
#
# As order is important, each puppet::auth declartion must have an order
# parameter given in the form [A-Z]\d{3}, i.e a capital letter followed by 3
# digits, triple zero entries [A-Z]000 are reserved for headings.
# This give 26,000 slots which should give a fine grained enough order.
#
# See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/rest_auth_conf.html for a more complete
# description of auth.conf's behavior.

### A000: Blocks A to L contain authenticated ACLs - these rules apply only when
### the client has a valid certificate and is thus authenticated
